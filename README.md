# Functional-Analysis-Note

Functional analysis is a rich subject because it combines two large branches of mathematic: the *topological* branch concerns itself with convergence, continuity,
connectivity, boundedness, etc.; and the *algebraic* branch concerns itself with operations, groups, rings, vectors, etc. Since this is the introductory course on Functional Analysis, in this course, we mainly focus on these parts:

* Some Preliminaries in Analysis
* Metric space
* Normed Linear space, Banach Space
* Linear vector space, Linear operator and Dual Space
* Inner Product space, Hilbert Space

As you can see in this note, we do not pay much attention in algebraic branch (as I don't have to much background on algebra :(

**STATEMENT**: I use Prof. Joseph Muscat's book as the main material, thus, there is a lot of content that comes from the book, however, I also do paraphrase and add some footnotes to help me understand the concepts. Thus, if the expression of the definition is different from your textbook or lecture notes, please stick to your version. Considered of my limited ability, mistakes are inevitable. Correction and suggestions are welcomed.
