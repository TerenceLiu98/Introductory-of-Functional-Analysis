\section{Set Theory and Logic}

\subsection{Fundamental Concepts}

Here we introduce the ideas of set theory, and establish the basic terminology and notation. We also discuss some points of elementary logic.

\subsubsection{Basic Notation}

Commonly we shall use capital letters $A, B, \dots$ to denote \textbf{\uwave{set}}, and lowercase letters $a, b, \dots,$ to denote the \textbf{\uwave{elements}} belonging to these sets. If an element $a$ belongs to a set $A$, we  express this fact by the notation $a \in A$; for the contradiction, if $a$ does not belong to $A$, we express this fact by writing: $a \not\in A$. 

The equality symbol $=$ is used throughout this note to mean \uwave{logical identity}. Thus, when we say $a = b$, we mean $a$ and $b$ are symbols for the same element. Similarly, if $a$ and $b$ are different elements, we write $a \neq b$.

We say that $A$ is a \textbf{\uwave{subset}} if $B$ if every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$, denoted by $A \subset B$; ($\forall x \in A, x \in B$) Noting in this definition requires $A$ being different from $B$; in fact, \uline{if $A = B$, it is true that both $A \subset B$ and $B \subset A$.} If $A \subset B$ and $A$ is different from $B$, then, we say that $A$ is \textbf{\uwave{proper subset}} of $B$, denoted by $A \subseteq B$.\footnote{The relations $\subset$ and $\subseteq$ are called \textbf{\uwave{inclusion} and \uwave{proper inclusion}}, respectively.}

\subsubsection{Operations with Sets}

\paragraph{The Union of Sets and the meaning of "or"} Given two sets $A$ and $B$, one can form a set from them that consists of all the elements of $A$ together with all elements of $B$. This set is called \textbf{\uwave{the union}} of $A$ and $B$, is denoted by $A \cup B$. Formally, we define $A \cup B = \{x: x\in A, x \in B\}$. The union of two sets, means the elements of the new sets is from $A$, or from $B$, or from both $A$ and $B$.

\paragraph{The Intersection of Sets, and the Empty Set} Given sets $A$ and $B$, another way one can form a set is to take the common part of $A$ and $B$. This set is called the \textbf{\uwave{intersection}} of $A$ and $B$ and is denoted by $A \cap B$. Formally, we define $A \cap B = \{x: x\in A \text{ and } x \in B\}$. If the set $A$ and $B$ has no common element, then we call the intersection of $A$ and $B$ is a \textbf{\uwave{empty set}}, $A \cap B = \varnothing$. We also express this fact by saying that $A$ and $B$ are \textbf{\uwave{disjoint}}.

\paragraph{The Difference of Two Sets} There is one other operation on sets that is occasionally useful. it is the \textbf{\uwave{difference}} of two sets, denoted by $A - B$ or $A \backslash B$. It is defined as the set consisting of those elements of $A$ that are not in $B$. Formally, we define $A - B = A \backslash B = \{x: x\in A \text{ and } x \not\in B\}$

\subsubsection{Rules of Set Theory}

Given several sets, one may form new sets by applying the set-theoretic operations to them. As in algebra, one uses parentheses to indicate in what order the operations are to be performed. For example, $A \cup (B \cap C)$ denotes the union of the two set $A$ and $B \cap C$, while $(A \cup B) \cap C$ denotes the intersection of the two sets $A \cup B$ and $C$. Sometimes different combinations of operations lead to the same set, when that happens, one has a rule of set theory (which can be thought of as a ``distributive law" for the operations $\cup$ and $\cap$):
\newpage
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0pt,topsep=0pt]
    \item $A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)$
    \item $A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C)$
\end{enumerate}

and \textbf{\uwave{DeMorgan's Law}}:
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0pt,topsep=0pt]
    \item $A \backslash (B\cup C) = (A \backslash B) \cap (A \backslash C)$
    \item $A \backslash (B\cap C) = (A \backslash B) \cup (A \backslash C)$
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Collections of Sets}

The elements belonging to a set may be of any sort. One can consider the set of all even integers, and the set of all blue-eyed people in the world. Some of these are of limited mathematical interest. Can the set be elements of another sets? The answer is yes. We now have another way to form new sets from old ones. Given a set $A$, we can consider sets whose elements are subsets of $A$. In particular, \uwave{we can consider the set of all subsets of $A$.} This set is sometimes denoted by the symbol $\mathcal{P}(A)$ and is called the \textbf{\uwave{power set}} of $A$.\footnote{Why we can the collection of $A$'s subset a power set? If $A= \{a, b, c\}$, then $\mathcal{P}(A) = \{\varnothing, \{a\}, \{b\}, \{c\}, \{a, b\}, \{a, c\}, \{b, c\}, \{a, b, c\}\}$ contains $8$ elements, and $2^3 = 8$, thus, it is named as \textbf{power} set.}

When we have \uline{a set whose elements are sets}, we shall often refer to it as a \textbf{\uwave{collection of sets}} and denoted it by a script letter such as $\mathcal{A}$ or $\mathcal{B}$. 

Thus, if $A = \{a, b, c\}$, then $a$ is a element of $A$ ($a \in A$), $\{a\}$ is a subset of $A$ ($\{a\} \subset A$), $\{a\}$ is a element of $\mathcal{P}(A)$($\{a\} \in \mathcal{P}(A)$).

\paragraph{Arbitrary Union and Intersections} We have already defined what we mean by the union and the intersection of two sets. There is no reason to limit ourselves to just two sets, for we can just as well form the union and intersection of arbitrarily many sets.

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0pt]
    \item Given a collection $\mathcal{A}$, the \textbf{\uwave{union}} of the elements of $\mathcal{A}$ is: $\bigcup_{A \in \mathcal{A}} A = \{x: x \in A \text{ for at least one } A \in \mathcal{A}\}$
    \item Given a collection $\mathcal{A}$, the \textbf{\uwave{intersection}} of the elements of $\mathcal{A}$ is: $\bigcap_{A \in \mathcal{A}} A = \{x: x \in A \text{ for every } A \in \mathcal{A}\}$
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Cartesian products}

There is yet another way of forming new sets from old ones; it involves the notion of an ``ordered pair" of objects. When we are considering a point $(x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^2$, we are actually defining a ``ordered pair" of real number $(x, y)$. (In a more sophisticated treatment of geometry, the plane, is more likely to be defined as the set of all ordered pairs of real numbers)

The notion of ordered pair carries over to general sets. Given two sets $A$ and $B$m we define their \textbf{\uwave{cartesian product}} $A \times B$ to be the set of all ordered pair $(a, b), \forall a \in A, \forall b \in B$. Formally, $A \times B = \{(a, b): a \in A, b \in B\}$.


\subsection{Functions}

A function is usually thought of as a \uwave{rule} that assigns to each element of a set $A$, an element of a set $B$, In calculus, a function is often given by a simple formula such as $f(x) = 3x^2 + 2$ or perhaps by a more complicated formula such as $f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty}x^i$.

\begin{definition}[rule of assignment]
\textbf{\uwave{A rule of assignment}} is a subset $r$ of the Cartesian product $C \times D$ of two sets, having the property that each element of $C$ appears as the firs coordinate of at most one ordered pair belonging to $r$.
\end{definition}

Thus, a subset $r$ of $C \times D$ is a rule of assignment if $[(c, d) \in r \text{ and } [c^{\prime}, d^{\prime}] \in r] \Rightarrow [d = d^{\prime}]$. We think of $r$ as a way of assigning, to the element $c$ of $C$, the element $d$ of $D$ for which $(c, d) \in r$.

Given a rule of assignment $r$, the \textbf{\uwave{domain}} of $r$ is defined to be the subset of $C$ consisting of all first coordinates of elements of $r$, and the \textbf{\uwave{image set}} of $r$ is defined as the subset of $D$ consisting of all second coordinates of elements of $r$. Formally:
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0pt]
    \item domain $r= \{c: \text{ these exists } d \in D \text{ such that } (c, d) \ in r\}$
    \item image $r = \{d: \text{ these exists } c \in C \text{ such that } (c, d) \ in r\}$
\end{enumerate}

Note that given a rule of assignment $r$, its domain and image are entirely determined.

\begin{definition}[function]
A \textbf{\uwave{function}} $f$ is a rule of assignment $r$, together with a set $B$ that contains the image set of $r$. The domain $A$ of the rule $r$ is also called the \textbf{domain} of function $f$; the image set of $r$ is also called the \textbf{image set} of $f$; and the set $B$ is called the \textbf{range} of $f$.\footnote{Analysts are apt to use the word ``range" to denote what we have called the ``image set" of $f$. They avoid giving the set $B$ a name.}

If $f$ is a function having domain $A$ and range $B$, we express this fact by writing $f: A \mapsto B$, which is read ``$f$ is a function from $A$ to $B$.", or ``$f$ maps $A$ to $B$".
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[resitriction]
If $f: A \mapsto B$ and if $A_0$ is a subset of $A$, we define the \textbf{\uwave{restriction}} of $f$ to $A_0$ to be the function mapping $A_0$ into $B$ whose rule is $\{(a, f(a)) | a \in A_0\}$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[composite]
Given functions $f:A \mapsto B$ and $g: B \mapsto C$, we define the \textbf{\uwave{composite}} $g \circ f$ of $f$ and $g$ as the function $g \circ f: A \mapsto C$ defined by the equation $(g \circ f)(a) = g(f(a)), a \in A$. Formally, $g \circ f: A \mapsto C$ is the function whose rule is $\{(a, c), \text{ for some } b\in B, f(a) = b \text{ and } g(b) = c\}$.
\end{definition}

Considering two physical movement: rotation and translation, if we first rotate a object and then do the translation, it is a kind of composite function $g \circ f$.

    \caption{$g \circ f$}

\end{figure}

\begin{definition}[injective, surjective, bijective]
A function $f: A \mapsto B$ is said to be \textbf{\uwave{injective (or one-to one)}} if for each pair of distinct points of $A$, their images under $f$ are distinct. It is said to be \textbf{\uwave{surjective}} (or $f$ is said to map $A$ \textbf{onto} $B$) if every element of $B$ is the image of some element of $A$ under the function $f$. If $f$ is both \uwave{injective and surjective}, it is said to be \textbf{\uwave{bijective}} (or is called a \uwave{ono-to-one correspondence}).
\end{definition}

More formally, $f$ is \uwave{injective} if $[f(a) = f(a^{\prime})] \Rightarrow [a = a^{\prime}]$; $f$ is \uwave{surjective} if $[b \in B] \Rightarrow [b \in f(a) \text{ for at least one } a\in A]$

If $f$ is bijective, there exists a function from $B$ to $A$ is called \textbf{\uwave{inverse}} of $f$, denoted by $f^{-1}$ and is defined by letting $f^{-1}(b), b \in B$ be that unique element $a \in A$ for which $f(a) = b$.

\begin{lemmad}
Let $f: A \mapsto B$. If there are functions $g: B \mapsto A$ and $g: B \mapsto A$ such that $g(f(a)) = a$ for every $a \in A$ and $f(h(b)) = b$ for $b \in B$, then $f$ is a bijective and $g = h = f^{-1}$.
\end{lemmad}

\begin{definition}[image and preimage of a subset]
Let $f: A \mapsto B$. If $A_0$ is a subset of $A$, we denote by $f(A_0)$ the set of all images of point of $A_0$ under the function $f$; this set is called the \textbf{\uwave{image of $A_0$ under $f$}}. Formally, $f(A_0) = \{b: b = f(a) \text{ for at least one } a\in A_0\}$. O the other hand, if $B_0$ is a subset of $B$, we denote by $f^{-1}(B_0)$ the set of all element of $A$ whose images under $f$ lies in $B_0$; it is called the \textbf{\uwave{preimage}} of $B_0$ under $f$. Formally, $f^{-1}(B_0) = \{a: f(a) \in B_0\}$.
\end{definition}

Note that if $f:A \mapsto B$ is a bijective and $B_0 \subset B$, then $B_0$ is the \uwave{image of $f$} and the \uwave{preimage of $f^{-1}$}. 

\subsection{Relations}

A more general concept of functions is the \textbf{relation}.

\begin{definition}[relation]
A \textbf{\uwave{relation}} on a set $A$ is a subset $C$ of the cartesian product $A \times A$.
\end{definition}

If $C$ is a relation on $A$, we use the notation $xCy$ to mean the same thing as $(x, y) \in C$. and we read it as ``$x$ in the relation $C$ to $y$".

A rule of assignment $r$ for a function $f: A \mapsto A$ is also a subset of $A \times A$. But it is a subset of a very special kind: namely, one such that each element of $A$ appears as the first coordinate of an element of $r$ exactly once. Any subset of $A \times A$ is a relation on $A$.

\paragraph{Equivalence Relations and Partitions} An \textbf{\uwave{equivalence relation}} on a st $A$ is a relation $C$ on $A$ having the following three properties:
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0pt]
    \item (Reflexivity) $xCx$ for every $x \in A$
    \item (Symmetry) If $xCy$, then $yCx$
    \item (Transitivity) If $xCy$ and $yCz$, then $xCz$
\end{enumerate}

There is no reason one must use a capital letter  - or indeed a letter of any sort - to denote a relation, even though it is a (ordered-pair) set. Another symbol will do just as well, One symbol that is frequently used to denoted an equivalence relation become 
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0pt]
    \item $x \sim x$ for every $x \in A$
    \item If $x \sim y$, then $y \sim x$
    \item If $x \sim y$ and $y \sim z$, then $x \sim z$
\end{enumerate}

Given an equivalence relation $\sim$ on $A$ and an element $x$ of $A$, we define a certain subset $E$ of $A$, called the \textbf{\uwave{equivalence class}} determined by $x$, by the equation $E = \{y: y \sim x\}$. Notice that the equivalence class $E$ determined by $x$ contains $x$, since $x \sim x$, The set $E$ have the following property:

\begin{lemmad}
Two equivalence classes $E$ and $E^{\prime}$ are either disjoint or equal.
\end{lemmad}
\begin{proof}
Let $E$ be the equivalence class determined by $x$, correspondingly $E^{\prime}$ is the equivalence class determined by $x^{\prime}$. First we assume $E \cap E^{\prime} = \varnothing$, thus, they are disjoint; then we consider $E \cap E^{\prime} \neq \varnothing$, and assume the interception contains an element $y$. Since $y \in E$, thus, $y \sim x_i, \forall x_i \in E$. Similarly, $y \in E^{\prime}$, thus, $y \sim x^{\prime}_i, \forall x^{\prime}_i \in E^{\prime}$. With the property of transitivity, we can get $x \sim x^{\prime}$, thus, $E$ and $E^{\prime}$ are equal.
\end{proof}

Given an equivalence relation on a set $A$, let us denote by $\mathcal{E}$ the collection of all equivalence classes determined by this relation. The proceeding lemma shows that distinct element of $\mathcal{E}$ are disjoint. Furthermore, the union of the elements of $\mathcal{E}$ equals all of $A$ because every element of $A$ belongs to an equivalence class. The collection $\mathcal{E}$ is a particular example of what is called a \uwave{partition} of $A$:

\begin{definition}[partition]
A \textbf{\uwave{partition}} of a set $A$ is a collection of disjoint nonempty subset of $A$ whose union is all of $A$. Formally, $\bigcup_{E \in \mathcal{E}} E = A$.
\end{definition}

Studying equivalence relations on a set $A$ and studying partitions of $A$ are really the same thing. Given any partition $\mathcal{D}$ of $A$, there is exactly one equivalence relation on $A$ from which it is derived.

\paragraph{Order Relations}

A relation $C$ on a set $A$ is called an \textbf{\uwave{order relation}} (or a \uwave{simple order}, or \uwave{linear order}) if it has the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0pt]
    \item (Comparability) For every $x$ and $y$ in $]A$ for which $x \not y$, either $xCy$ or $yCx$.
    \item (Nonreflexivity) For no $x$ in $A$ does the relation $xCx$ hold.
    \item (Transitivity) If $xCy$ and $yCz$, then $xCz$
\end{enumerate}

Note that the ``Comparability" does not by itself exclude the possibility that for some pair of elements $x$ and $y$ of $A$, both the relations $xCy$ and $yCx$ holds. But the ``Nonreflexivity" and ``Transitivity" combined do exclude this possibility; for if both $xCy$ and $yCx$ held, transitivity would imply that $xCx$, contradicting nonreflexivity.

As the tilde, $\sim$, is the generic symbol for an equivalence relation, the ``less than" symbol, $<$, is commonly used to denote an order relation. Stated in this notation, we can rewrite the above three properties:
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0pt]
    \item (Comparability) If $x \neq y$, then either $x < y$ or $y < x$
    \item (Nonreflexivity) If $x < y$, then $x \neq y$
    \item (Transitivity) If $x < y$ and $y < z$, then $x < z$
\end{enumerate}

\begin{definition}
If $(X, <)$ is a set with order relation, and if $a < b$, we use notation $(a, b)$ to denote the set $\{x: a < x < b\}$; it is called an \textbf{\uwave{open interval}} in $X$. If this set is empty, we call $a$ the \textbf{\uwave{immedia predecessor}} of $b$, and we call $b$ the \textbf{\uwave{immedia predecessor}} of $a$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Suppose that $A$ and $B$ are two sets with order relations respectively. We say that two sets have the same \textbf{\uwave{order type}} if there is a bijective correspondence between them that preserves order; that is, if there exists a bijective function $f:A \mapsto B$ such that $a_1 <_A a_2 \Rightarrow f(a_1) <_B (a_2)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
If $a_1 \leq_A a_2$, or if $a_1 - a_2$ and $b_1 <_B b_2$. It is called the \textbf{\uwave{dictionary order relation}} on $A \times B$. 
\end{definition}

With the order, we can do the comparison within the group. One example is the ``least upper bound property". One can define this property for an arbitrary ordered set. First, we need some preliminary definitions.

Suppose that $A$ is a set ordered by the relation $<$. Let $A_0$ be a subset of $A$. We say that the element $b$ is the \textbf{largest element} of $A_0$ if $b \in A_0$ and if $x \leq b$ for every  $x \in A_0$. Similarly, we say that is the \textbf{smallest element} of $A_0$ if $a \in A_0$. It is easy to see that \uwave{a set has at most one largest element and at most one smallest elements.}

We say that the subset $A_0$ of $A$ is \textbf{bounded above} if there is an element $b$ of $A$ such that $x \leq b$ for every $x \in A_0$; the element $b$ is called an \textbf{upper bound} of the subset $A_0$. If the set of all upper bound for $A_0$ has a smallest element, the element is called \textbf{the least upper bound}, or simply the \textbf{supremum}, of $A_0$. the supremum is denoted as $\sup{A_0}$;it may or may not belong to $A_0$. If it does, it is the largest element of $A_0$.

Similarly, we say that the subset of $A_0$ of $A$ is \textbf{bounded below} if there is an element $b$ of $A$ such that $x \geq b$ for every $x \in A_0$; the element $b$ is called an \text{lower bound} of the subset $A_0$. If the set of all lower bound for $A_0$ has a largest element, the element is called \textbf{the greatest lower bound}, or the \textbf{infimum}, of the subset $A_0$. It is denoted by $\inf{A_0}$; it may or may not belong to $A_0$. If it does, it is the smallest element of $A_0$.

\begin{definition}
An ordered set $A$ is said to have the \textbf{least upper bound property} if every nonempty subset $A_0$ of $A$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound. Analogously, the set $A$ is said to have the \textbf{\uwave{greatest lower bound property}} if every nonempty subset $A_0$ of $A$ that is bounded below has a greatest lower bound.
\end{definition}
